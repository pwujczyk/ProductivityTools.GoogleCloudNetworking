# Observability

In GCP two main observability services are available: Monitoring and Logging

## Monitoring
We use **Metrics explorer** to check out metrics. When we open Metrics explorer we need to choose metric that we would like to monitor. The easiest example is CPU load for the VM

## Logging 
Logging service presents all the events that happened to chosen resources. One of the example of the event is incoming request to VM.
