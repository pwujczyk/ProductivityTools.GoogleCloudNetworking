# VPC Firewall

GCP allows to configure firewalls on different levels

## VPC Firewall
During VPC network creation we can create Firewall rules. By default all ingress (from Internet) is denied and all egress is allowed.

The rules are applied on the network level and validated during each data exchange. I think about these as rules that are applied on each VM that is in the network like VM firewall.

- [We cannot ping vm1 instance from vm2 instance without new rule on VPC Firewall](./Firewals-SSH-Ping/Index.md)
