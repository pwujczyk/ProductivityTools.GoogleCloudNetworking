# URL filtering

Functionality allows to filter requests based on the url list. 
Next Generation Firwall allows to filter trafic based on the Fully Qualified Domain Name (www.google.com) but does not allow to filter on the url (www.google.com/maps). URL filtering option allows to do that.

When to use:
- If we have under one domain multiple sites (google.com/maps, google.com)
- If site that we would like to block is hosted under multiple IPs or the IP of the page changes
