Let us go through example

I see that I have one button disabled and when I hover it I see that I miss permissions
![permission-issue](./images/permission-issue.png)



Clicking View details I see that the resource that I need permission is the productivitytools.top organization

![resource](./images/resource.png)


Let us go to the policy troubleshooter IAM and Admin > Policy Troubleshooter

I provided the email that I am logged in and the permission that was listed in the tooltip.

![policy-troubleshooter](./images/policy-troubleshooter.png)



For the resource I chose Browse and look for the resource that was listed in the side panel - productivitytools.top
